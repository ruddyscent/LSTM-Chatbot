    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a chatbot that can converse with you at the command line. The chatbot will use a Sequence to Sequence text generation architecture with an LSTM as it's memory unit. You will also learn to use pretrained word embeddings to improve the performance of the model. At the conclusion of the project, you will be able to show your chatbot to potential employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you have the option to use pretrained word embeddings in your model. We have loaded Brown Embeddings from Gensim in the starter code below. You can compare the performance of your model with pre-trained embeddings against a model without the embeddings.\n",
